# DesignType

This is a questionaire which attempts to find out how you design software. Just like psychological tests can describe a person's personality, this test tries to distinguish several design types.

## Basic idea

The questionaire is based on four dimensions a developer is located:
* __simple vs. powerful__
* __abstract vs. concrete__
* __pragmatic vs. idealistic__
* __robust vs. technologic__

## Additional Benefits

Once you have understood the meaning of the dimensions you know very well about the particular motivations behind several design decisions. This enable you to use this framework for communication when you talk about design decisions with colleagues. Another thing is to extend a (project) team with the most fitting colleague.
