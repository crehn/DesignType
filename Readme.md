# DesignType

This is questionaire which attempts to find out how you design software. Just like psychological tests can describe a person's personality, this test tries to distinguish several design types.

# Basic idea

The questionaire is based on four dimensions a developer is located in:
* __simple vs. powerful__
* __abstract vs. concrete__
* __pragmatic vs. idealistic__
* __robust vs. technologic__

# Representative Website
