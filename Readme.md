DesignType
==========

This is questionaire which attempts to find out how you design software. Just like psychological tests can describe a person's personality, this test tries to distinguish several design types.

Basic idea
===========

The questionaire is based on four dimensions a developer is located in:
#simple vs. powerful
#abstract vs. concrete
#pragmatic vs. idealistic
#robust vs. technologic
