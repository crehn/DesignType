        <h1>How Do You Design Software?</h1>
        <p>
            Find out by answering this questionaire.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            As developers we frequently make design decisions. They can be as general as "How many levels of abstractions do I need?" or "Which framework should I use?" and as concrete as "How to name this method?" and "In which order should these values be supplied?". They center around modularization (how to break a problem down into classes and methods), interface design (how to craft these modules such that they are easily useable) and internal module structure (how to compose the inner workings of classes).
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately there is no single correct solution for any of these questions. There are many bad solutions but there typically are several "good" ones. Deciding among these good solutions is not an objective task as each of them has different benefits and drawbacks. So the decisions are made in a subjective way which depends on a developer's way of thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            The different attitudes may lead to frequent arguments on which way is best. The following questionaire may help to find out how you make design decisions. You may even try to use it to find out how your colleagues think about software design. We hope that a better understanding of how other developers think, improves the communication in a team.

        <h1>Final Remarks</h1>
        <p>
            This categorization is by far not covering all aspects of a developer. Working style, prefered development process, people skills, and many other aspects are neglected here. That's also not the goal of this questionaire. Rather the hope is that this structure helps you to understand how your colleagues think when they make design decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This questionaire is still work in progress. It still hasn't been tried out how well the mapping of the selected statements to design types works. Neither it's clear whether the design types are described correctly. Feedback is welcome.
