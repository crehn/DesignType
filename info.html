        <h1>Principles, Dimensions, and Design Types</h1>
        <p>
            This page describes a few more details, terms and thoughts. In our mind there are 4 dimensions that contain two nearly contrary parts or directions. These directions are not meant to be extreme points but rather a kind of set that contains similar attitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s make an example: <em>Simple</em> means to omit things that are not really necessary like never requested features. In an extreme manner it can mean to omit also documentation because really simple code is documentation enough. This can be but does not have to.
        </p>
        <p>
            What we mean is that all dimensions have a wide range of aspects. You can agree with many of them but do not have to agree to all. To get a contrast between the two parts of a dimension we tried to find naturally contrary mindsets. We use these to force you to decide to which side you belongs most. Well knowing that there are developers who will be very balanced, we agreed in that there will be also ones who are typically extreme. When you think about your colleagues you will quickly know who is extremely dedicated to a specific dimension. Those are often very original guys. In many cases for each person one or two dimensions overshaddow the others and form the impression of others about this person.
        </p>
        <p>
            Find out more about the definition of all dimensions by exploring our <a href="dimensions.html">dimensions page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we combine all the predominating dimensions of someone it results in a design type. SAPR for example is the combination of the attitudes Simple – Abstract – Pragmatic – Robust. Someone who is Abstract focuses on concepts and abstractions to find a good structure for his application. If he is also Pragmatic he maybe will tend to violate this structure for satisfying customer needs. If he is also Idealistic he maybe will over engineer the whole system structure. Your predominate dimensions effect each other. In our Design Types we specify these different combinations and describe the consequences for each type.
Find out more about these combinations by exploring our <a href="types.html">design types page</a>.
