                    <h2>Use Case and Preparation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Use the quiz and the learning game to get familiar with the
                        Design Cards and with arguments and principles of software
                        design. Use a single card set and read the cards before
                        playing. Start with the basic set (<img src="img/cards/basic_set.png" />)
                        and add the other cards once you are familiar with it.

                    <p>
                        We've tried the basic rules for the quiz and the learning game but we have several more ideas
                        and maybe you come up with something else. Feel free to post your ideas and experiences in the
                        comments.

                    <h1>Quiz</h1>
                    <h2>Basic Rules for 2+ Players</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Shuffle the cards.</li>
                        <li>Take turns. When it’s your turn, one of the other players draws
                            a card and reads the title to you.</li>
                        <li>If you can correctly explain the card based on the title, you get a point.</li>
                        <li>If your answer is not correct the other players get a chance.</li>
                        <li>In any case read the card aloud. Then it's the next player’s turn—even if this person
                            already got a point by explaning your card.</li>
                        <li>The game ends after 5 rounds (adjust based on the time you want to spend).</li>
                        <li>The player with the most points wins.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>More Ideas</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sort the cards by color so you have separate stacks of cards. When you draw a card, you can
                            choose which stack to choose from.</li>
                        <li>Cards from the basic set (<img src="img/cards/basic_set.png" />) get one point, cards from
                            the advanced set get two, and extended set cards (once when there will be such) three.</li>
                        <li>If you can name a situation from a past project where the argument on the card was
                            considered or could have been considered, you get an additional point.</li>
                        <li>If you can name even a situation where using the card could have prevented a problem, you
                            get an additional point.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>Learning Game</h1>
                    <h2>Basic Rules for 4+ Players</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Split up into two teams who will play against each other.</li>
                        <li>Remove action and question cards and shuffle the rest.</li>
                        <li>Take turns. When it’s your turn, draw a card, read it quietly and try to explain the card
                            without mentioning the words in the title or synonyms/antonyms thereof.
                            <strong>TIP:</strong> Read the card carefully and use the examples given.
                        </li>
                        <li>While you explain, your team member(s) have 90 sec. to guess the title. If they manage to
                            do so, your team gets a point.</li>
                        <li>If your team members couldn’t guess correctly, the opposing team gets one single guess to
                            get a point for themselves.</li>
                        <li>In any case read the card aloud. Then it’s the turn of the other team.</li>
                        <li>Every player should get the chance to explain and to guess. So also take turns within the
                            teams.</li>
                        <li>The game ends after each team has read 5 cards (adjust based on the time you want to
                            spend).</li>
                        <li>The team with the most points wins.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>More Ideas</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't remove action and question cards. They can also be part of the game.</li>
                        <li>Instead of explaining the card with words, you can draw a picture (think of diagrams or
                            examples).</li>
                        <li>Split each turn into two phases. First the card is explained and the team members just
                            listen. Then the team members discuss among each other and decide on the answer. The first
                            answer they agree on counts.</li>
                    </ul>
