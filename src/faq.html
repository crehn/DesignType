                    <h1>General/Design Knights</h1>
                    <h2>Do you want to make money with this?</h2>
                    <p>
                        If making money was our goal, we should have chosen a different activity. Actually this is
                        supposed to be a kind of community project. We think it's a cool idea, we want to explore these
                        ideas and hope that the content we produce is also helpful to others. We do this because of the
                        same reasons other people contribute to open source projects. It's fun, it's creative, and
                        maybe it's even helpful.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Will the content stay free?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Absolutely, yes. We might, sometime in the future, also produce content which is not free
                        (although there are no concrete plans for that). But everything that's free now, will be free
                        forever. After all providing something for free typically means that we reach more people. And
                        we'd like to be helpful to as many people as possible.
                    </p>

                    <h2>So is design-types.net an open source project?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Not exactly. Among others there are licensing issues which prevent us from really open-sourcing
                        the content. So it's free as in free beer but not free as in free speech.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How can I contribute?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The simplest way to contribute is to contribute feedback. If you have an idea, if you've found
                        a mistake or if you want to share your experience or thoughts just write an email or a comment
                        here on the website. We like getting feedback.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How can I support?</h2>
                    <p>
                        design-types.net and everything around it requires a significant portion of our spare time. But
                        that's OK. It's fun and we have a regular job for earning money. Nevertheless we are greateful
                        for every support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The easiest way to support, is to tell others about the website and the ideas. Talk to your
                        friends and colleagues, write blog posts, and share links to the website. We are more
                        interested in reach than money. If you want to support us financially, you can
                        <a href="cards_get_them.html">buy Design Cards sets</a> and make donations via paypal.

                    <h1>Design Types</h1>
                    <h2>It's difficult to decide which statements to pick. Why do I have to pick exactly five?</h2>
                    <p>

                    </p>

                    <h2>Why yet another typology?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are plenty of other typologies, that's true. But these other typologies are typically
                        generel ones. The Design Types capture specifically how you make design decisions in software
                        development.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Is the typology based on other typologies?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes and no. In psychology the standard taxonomy for describing personality traits is called <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">the Big Five</a>. This
                        model consists of five dimensions: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness,
                        and neuroticism. Openness roughly corresponds to robust-vs-technologic. And there is also a
                        certain similarity between conscientiousness and pragmatic-vs-idealistic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In consulting and human resource management the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers–Briggs_Type_Indicator">
                            Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories">Team
                            Roles by Meredith Belbin</a> are widely used. MBTI, similar to the Design Types, has four
                        dimensions and type abbreviations. And Belbin's model is similar to ours because it also
                        specializes on a specific aspect rather than providing a general model of personality.

                        Actually we don't know. As we don't draw any commission and just redirect to Spreadshirt, we
                        can only guess.

                    <h1>Design Matrix</h1>
                    <h2>When shall I use the Design Matrix?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Currently the Design Matrix is just a tool and not a complete method. Up until now we can only
                        give hints what we think might be valid uses. The Design Matrix may be helpful when you are
                        about to make an important design decision, when you prepare a decision to be presented to the
                        team, the architect, or management or when you want to assess past design decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It MAY be helpful in these and similar situations, but currently we don't have enough evidence
                        to construct a proven method for its use. Please share your experiences with the Design Matrix.
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <a id="cards"></a>
                    <h1>Design Cards</h1>
                    <h2>When shall I use the Design Cards?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Similar to the Design Matrix, the Design Cards are merely a tool, you could call them a
                        technique but there is no complete method, i.e. we don't prescribe a kind of process when the
                        Design Cards are to be used. To a certain extend this is on purpose as we believe that
                        processes have to be flexible and you shouldn't be dogmatic when applying software design
                        techniques. On the other hand we still don't know enough, we still don't have enough experience
                        in using the cards to create a sound method. So when you use the Design cards, please share
                        your expereinces.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why isn't there a card for principle X?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are a limited amount of card. Only 54 of them will fit into the box. So we simply had to
                        make a choice. These 54 cards are the ones we belive are the most helpful while still being
                        broadly applicable. There is the tendency that the more helpful a principle is, the more
                        specific it will be. The same holds true for software components by the way: Either a component
                        is very helpful, then it's typically a very specific component implementing some business
                        logic. Or a component is very reusable (like a library function) but then it's quite useless on
                        its own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So we tried to have some very abstract and general principles as well as some concrete and
                        specific ones. The Design Cards are supposed to be helpful in a wide variety of cases so there
                        are some more general then specific cards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We might provide a second volume of the Design Cards in the future. So stay turned if 54 cards
                        are not enough for you.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why didn't you include all the SOLID principles?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The SOLID principles may be well known but in our opinion they are not the most helpful
                        principles. SRP is part of the Design Cards. Instead of OCP we included ECV which captures
                        roughly the same idea but is easier to understand. LSP is very specific and mostly helpful to
                        library authors or if you have very complex domain models. ISP and DIP are good but in many
                        cases LC suffices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In total the SOLID principles are good but simply made a different choice.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why is there Low Coupling (LC) but not High Cohesion (HC)?</h2>
                    <p>
                        SRP is essentially a slightly more specific version of HC. There is no point in including them
                        both but SRP is slightly easier to apply.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Is there any difference between the download version and the printed cards?</h2>
                    <p>
                        No. The contents is exactly the same.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Can I contribute or create custom cards?</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the future we will provide a way to do so. Up until then, you can write us an email or post
                        your idea as a comment here on the website.
                    </p>

                    <h2>May I print the Design Cards myself and use them at work?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sure. Go ahead!
                    </p>

                    <h2>May I print the Design Cards and sell them myself?</h2>
                    <p>
                        No. For obvious reasons we don't like that.
