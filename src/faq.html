                    <h1>General/Design Knights</h1>
                    <h2>Do you want to make money with this?</h2>
                    <p>
                        If making money was our goal, we should have chosen a different activity. Actually this is
                        supposed to be a kind of community project. We think it's a cool idea, we want to explore these
                        ideas and hope that the content we produce is also helpful to others. We do this because of the
                        same reasons other people contribute to open source projects. It's fun, it's creative, and
                        maybe it's even helpful.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Will the content stay free?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Absolutely, yes. We might, sometime in the future, also produce content which is not free
                        (although there are no concrete plans for that). But everything that's free now, will be free
                        forever. After all providing something for free typically means that we reach more people. And
                        we'd like to be helpful to as many people as possible.
                    </p>

                    <h2>So is design-types.net an open source project?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Not exactly. Among others there are licensing issues which prevent us from really open-sourcing
                        the content. So it's free as in free beer but not free as in free speech.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How can I contribute?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The simplest way to contribute is to contribute feedback. If you have an idea, if you've found
                        a mistake or if you want to share your experience or thoughts just write an email or a comment
                        here on the website. We like getting feedback.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How can I support?</h2>
                    <p>
                        design-types.net and everything around it requires a significant portion of our spare time. But
                        that's OK. It's fun and we have a regular job for earning money. Nevertheless we are greatful
                        for every support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The easiest way to support, is to tell others. Talk to your friends and colleagues, write
                        blog posts, and share links to the website. You can also <a href="cards_get_them.html">buy
                            Design Cards sets</a> and make donations via paypal.

                    <a id="types"></a>
                    <h1>Design Types</h1>
                    <h2>It's difficult to decide which statements to pick. Why do I have to pick exactly five?</h2>
                    <p>

                    </p>

                    <h2>Why yet another typology?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are plenty of other typologies, that's true. But these other typologies are typically
                        generel ones. The Design Types capture specifically how you make design decisions in software
                        development.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Is the typology based on other typologies?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes and no. In psychology the standard taxonomy for describing personality traits is called <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">the big Five</a>. This
                        model consists of five dimensions: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness,
                        and neuroticism. Openness roughly corresponds to robust-vs-technologic. And there is also a
                        certain similarity between conscientiousness and pragmatic-vs-idealistic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In consulting and human resource management the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers–Briggs_Type_Indicator">
                            Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories">Team
                            Roles by Meredith Belbin</a> are widely used. MBTI, similar to the Design Types, has four
                        dimensions and type abbreviations. And Belbin's model is similar to ours because it also
                        specializes on a specific aspect rather than providing a general model of personality.

                    <h2>How many people have ordered a shirt?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Actually we don't know. As we don't draw any commission and just redirect to Spreadshirt, we
                        can only guess.

                    <h2>When shall I use the Design Matrix?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Currently the Design Matrix is just a tool and not a complete method.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Are there similar tools or techniques?</h2>

                    <h2>Is there any difference between the download version and the printed cards?</h2>
                    <p>
                        No. The contents is exactly the same.
                    </p>

                    <h2>When shall I use the Design Cards?</h2>
                    <p>

                    </p>

                    <h2>Why isn't there a card for principle X?</h2>
                    <p>

                    </p>

                    <h2>Can I contribute or create custom cards?</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the future we will provide a way to do so. Up until then, you can write us an email or post
                        your idea as a comment here on the website.
                    </p>

                    <h2>May I print the Design Cards myself and use them at work?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sure. Go ahead!

                    <h2>May I print the Design Cards and sell them myself?</h2>
                    <p>
                        No. For obvious reasons we don't like that.
