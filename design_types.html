            <h1>People are Different</h1>
            <p>
                Discussions among software developers can be quite exhausting, can't they? Ever wondered why you always argue with that particular
                colleague? This could be the case because your colleague is a stubborn idiot. But that's not very likely.
                It's much more likely that you and your colleague look at software design from a different perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course people are different in many ways. There are psychological differences and cultural ones, differences in experiece
                level, style of work, and educational background. People have different habits, different approaches and
                different character quirks. But there is also a difference in how we value certain aspects of design. Everyone
                of us has the tendency to emphasize certain aspects of software design. That's not a bad thing. It's a good
                thing. But it results in different opinions on which solution is best.
            </p>
            <p>
                Discussions are very valuable when different aspects complement each other and they are harmful when an endless discussion
                about two equally good solutions results in reduced productivity and a bad mood in th team.

        <section>
            <h1>Principles, Dimensions, and Design Types</h1>
            <p>
                This page describes a few more details, terms and thoughts. In our mind there are 4 dimensions that contain two nearly contrary
                parts or directions. These directions are not meant to be extreme points but rather a kind of set that contains
                similar attitudes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s make an example:
                <em>Simple</em> means to omit things that are not really necessary like never requested features. In an extreme
                manner it can mean to omit also documentation because really simple code is documentation enough. This can
                be but does not have to.
            </p>
            <p>
                What we mean is that all dimensions have a wide range of aspects. You can agree with many of them but do not have to agree
                to all. To get a contrast between the two parts of a dimension we tried to find naturally contrary mindsets.
                We use these to force you to decide to which side you belong most. Well knowing that there are developers
                who will be very balanced, we agreed in that there will be also ones who are typically extreme. When you
                think about your colleagues you will quickly know who is extremely dedicated to a specific dimension. Those
                are often very original guys. In many cases for each person one or two dimensions overshadow the others and
                form the impression of others about this person.
            </p>

            <p>
                When we combine all the predominating dimensions of someone it results in a design type. SAPR for example is the combination
                of the attitudes Simple – Abstract – Pragmatic – Robust. Someone who is Abstract focuses on concepts and
                abstractions to find a good structure for his application. If he is also Pragmatic he maybe will tend to
                violate this structure for satisfying customer needs. If he is also Idealistic he maybe will over engineer
                the whole system structure. Your predominate dimensions effect each other. In our Design Types we specify
                these different combinations and describe the consequences for each type.
            </p>
