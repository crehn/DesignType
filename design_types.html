                    <h1>People are Different</h1>
                    <p>
                        Discussions among software developers can be quite exhausting, can't they? Ever wondered why you always argue with that particular
                        colleague? This could be the case because your colleague is a stubborn idiot. But that's not very
                        likely. It's much more likely that you and your colleague look at software design from a different
                        perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course people are different in many ways. There are psychological differences and cultural ones, differences in experiece
                        level, style of work, and educational background. People have different habits, different approaches
                        and different character quirks. But there is also a difference in how we value certain aspects of
                        design. Everyone of us has the tendency to emphasize certain aspects of software design. That's not
                        a bad thing. It's a good thing. But it results in different opinions on which solution is best.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Discussions are very valuable when different aspects complement each other but they are harmful when an endless discussion
                        about two equally good solutions results in reduced productivity and a bad mood in the team.

                    <h1>Dimensions</h1>
                    <p>
                        There are four dimensions of software design:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>simple-vs-powerful: Some prefer simple solutions and some powerful and generic ones.</li>
                        <li>abstract-vs.concrete: Some prefer having a bird's eye view on software and others rather look
                            at every single line of code.</li>
                        <li>pragmatic-vs-idealistic. Some prefer producing value early on and others prefer building maintainable
                            software.
                        </li>
                        <li>robust-vs.technologic: Some prefer proven solutions and others like to experiment with new stuff.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Every dimension has its extremes but of course there are gray areas in between. Typically a solution cannot be 100% simple
                        and 100% generic at the same time. But solutions can be characterized somewhere on this scale. Likewise
                        the attitude of a software developer towards software design can be characterized on the same scale.
                        Some developers rather prefer simple solutions some powerful solutions some don't have a strong preference
                        on this scale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The preferences on these four dimensions largely influence which arguments we use in design discussions. Even more so, if
                        there is a strong preference in one dimension and lesser tendencies in others, this strong preference
                        often dominates a discussion.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h1>Types</h1>
                    <h2>Sorcerers, Ninjas, and Others</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are four dimensions each having two opposite sides. This results in 16 design types. Each type has an abbreviation
                        and a name. For example, a developer being Powerful, Concrete, Pragmatic, Robust is called "The Sorcerer"
                        (PCPR) and someone being Simple, Concrete, Pragmatric, Technologic is "The Ninja" (SCPT).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course this can be a bit simplistic -- especially as many people don't have a strong tendency in all dimensions. Nevertheless
                        it's a nice model which helps you understand yourself and your colleagues better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        None of these types is better than the other. They are just different. They have their strengths and weaknesses and their
                        very own view on how to design software. People with similar types argue less and discussions among
                        them result in agreements faster. But this also means that certain aspects of design are rather overlooked
                        when there is too much similarity.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Different Types Working Together</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some types complement each other but there are also type combinations that have difficulties working together. Especially
                        two idealistic people who are different in some other dimension often don't play well together. For
                        example an "Author" (SAIT) and a "Space Probe Engineer" (SAIR). Provided that they both have strong
                        tendencies in their dimensions, they will encounter some difficulties. The differnce in robust-vs-technologic
                        results in frequent disagreements and them both being idealistic intensifies their dispute and make
                        it hard for them to find a compromize.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This characterization scheme aims to provide a way to think about the differences you have. So you can better leverage these
                        differerences where they complement each other and understand your colleagues better when these differences
                        make discussions exhausting.
