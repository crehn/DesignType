                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary
                    and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and
                    the services offered there.</p>
                <p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred
                    to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording,
                    organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure
                    by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction,
                    erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
                <p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration,
                    and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others.
                    We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve
                    the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>
                <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Information about us as controllers of your data</li>
                    <li>The rights of users and data subjects</li>
                    <li>Information about the data processing</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>I. Information about us as Controllers of your Data</h3>
                <p>The party responsible for this website (the "controller") for purposes of data protection law is:</p>
                <p>
                    Matthias Wittum &amp; Christian Rehn GbR
                    <br> Goethestraße 23

                </p>

                <h3>II. The Rights of Users and Data Subjects</h3>
                <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the
                    right
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being
                        processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf.
                        also Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
                    <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
                    <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further
                        processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art.
                        18 GDPR;</li>
                    <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted
                        to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
                    <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being
                        processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections,
                    deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this
                    obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless,
                    users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future
                        processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to
                        data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong>
                </p>

                <h3>III. Information about the Data Processing</h3>
                <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage
                    ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations
                    or unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>

                <h4>Server Data</h4>
                <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will
                    be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type
                    and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages
                    on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited
                    our site.</p>
                <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>
                <p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement,
                    stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>
                <p>The data won't be deleted but it will be anonymized by truncating the IP address.</p>

                <h4>Cookies and Local Storage</h4>
                <h5>a) Local Storage</h5>
                <p>We use Local Storage which is technically similar to cookies. This is a small database managed by your browser.
                    We store the data you enter on our website (especially in our questionnaire) there until it is transferred
                    to our server.</p>
                <p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly. Without this data storage the questionnaire won't work
                    properly.
                </p>
                <p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies/data are used
                    to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p>
                <p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving
                    the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p>
                <p>When you close your browser, the data in local storage is not deleted so you can revisit the results of the
                    questionnaire.
                </p>
                <h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>
                <p>If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising,
                    analyzing, or improving the features of our website.</p>
                <p>Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose of such
                    third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.</p>
                <h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
                <p>You can refuse the use of cookies and local storage by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you
                    can use the browser to delete data that has already been stored. However, the steps and measures required
                    vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult
                    the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent
                    so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player.
                    The steps and measures required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any
                    questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your Flash player or contact
                    its maker for support.</p>
                <p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies/local storage, not all of the functions on our site
                    may be fully usable.
                </p>

                <h4>Questionnaire and Statistical Data</h4>
                <p>
                    If you use our questionnaire, we will use the data you enter. We use this data to create the questionannaire result for you.
                    Furthermore we use the data for research purposes (see our
                    <a href="statistics.html">statistiocs page</a> for examples).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don't ask your name but only statistical data so we normally don't have a means to identify you. IP addresses are logged
                    separately and in an anonymized way. If and only if you make the URL to your questionnaire result public,
                    i.e. if you tell us that a specific result of the questionnaire belongs to you, then we are able to correlate
                    that with the data you have entered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you'd like us to re-anonymize you data, just inform us about that and we will do so.
                </p>

                <h4>Contact</h4>
                <p>If you contact us via email, the data you provide will be used for the purpose of processing your request.
                    We must have this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will not be able to
                    answer it in full or at all.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
                <p>Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there is no further legal obligation
                    to store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.</p>

                <h4>User Comments</h4>
                <p>We offer you the opportunity to post comments on our website, hereinafter referred to jointly as "posts."
                    If you make use of this opportunity, we will process and publish your post, the date and time you submitted
                    it, and any pseudonym you may have used.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent under Art. 7 Para.
                    3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.</p>
                <p>In addition, we will also process your IP address and email address. The IP address is processed because
                    we might have a legitimate interest in taking or supporting further action if your post infringes the
                    rights of third parties and/or is otherwise unlawful.</p>
                <p>In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in any legal defense
                    we may have to mount.</p>

                <h4>Plugins and Embedded Content</h4>
                <h5>Twitter</h5>
                <p>Our website uses the plug-in of the Twitter social network. The Twitter service is operated by Twitter Inc.,
                    795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA ("Twitter").</p>
                <p>Through certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield</p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TORzAAO&amp;status=Active" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TORzAAO&amp;status=Active</a>
                </p>
                <p>Twitter guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection regulations when processing data in the United
                    States.
                </p>
                <p>The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in improving the quality of
                    our website.</p>
                <p>If the plug-in is stored on one of the pages you visit on our website, your browser will download an icon
                    for the plug-in from Twitter's servers in the USA. For technical reasons, it is necessary for Twitter
                    to process your IP address. In addition, the date and time of your visit to our website will also be
                    recorded.
                </p>
                <p>If you are logged in to Twitter while visiting one of our plugged-in websites, the information collected
                    by the plug-in from your specific visit will be recognized by Twitter. The information collected may
                    then be assigned to your personal account at Twitter. If, for example, you use the Twitter Tweet button,
                    this information will be stored in your Twitter account and may be published on the Twitter platform.
                    To prevent this, you must either log out of Twitter before visiting our site or make the appropriate
                    settings in your Twitter account.</p>

                    Whenever you visit a page where some user has commented, this service is called to fetch the avatar. For techniocal reasons
                    this transfers your IP address to the gravatar service. Whenever you leave a comment, the email address
                    you enter is transferred to gravatar. It is not sent in plain text but encrypted (or to be more precise:
                    hashed). So gravatar does not know your email address but it can distinguish you and your comments from
                    other people (meaning people with other email addresses).

                    In order to protect your privacy you can use a thow-away email address.

                <p>
                    You can order a personalized t-shirt via spreadshirt on our website. Spreadshirt is a shirt printing service offered by sprd.net
                    AG, Gießerstraße 27, 04229 Leipzig, Germany.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While you configure your shirt, we may load graphics from spreadshirt. For technical reasons this transferrs your IP address
                    to spreadshirt. The service may also set a cookie which identifies you across different websites providing
                    spreadshirt merchandise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you click the checkout button, your personal result (the graphic on the shirt) is transferred to spreadshirt. Furthermore
                    the shirt configuration you have entered (size, color) is also transferred. This is done so you can order
                    the shirt.
